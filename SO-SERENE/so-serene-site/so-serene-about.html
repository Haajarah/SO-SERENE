<h1> History of So Serene</h1>

<p1>With support from family and friends we managed to be where we are today and a very big thumbs up
for our lovely popular hardworking lady Yusra Abud. May God bless her and her family abundantly,
Ameen. As women we should empower other women and yes we can. Young and old we can all do it.

Our Serene products range are all organically handmade at home and contain no harsh chemicals, hence
short shelf life. All products are scented with varying oudh fragrances and are fully halaal. Our popular
and top selling product is the Oudh Body scrub which contains locally available dried flowers base oils,
essentials oils and fruit seeds exfoliants. Please give our products a try and visit us on instagram
(Serene_beauty_products), follow, share and invite friends on Facebook (So Serene). Should you need
further information please do not hesitate to contact us anytime.
